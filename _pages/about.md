I am a PhD candidate in [Computer Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science)  at [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/),
advised by Prof. [Aidong Zhang](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/aidong-zhang).

My research centers on two primary objectives:

  - _Enhancing learning efficiency with limited data_: Developing methods to improve model performance in low-data environments.
  - _Building robust models resistant to spurious patterns_: Designing models that are robust to superficial or misleading correlations.

Application areas include:
  - Designing machine learning models to learn high-quality genomic representations.
  - Leveraging Generative AI for domain-specific information retrieval and knowledge discovery.

 > `ðŸ“£ I am actively seeking internship, full-time, or postdoctoral positions and would be happy to discuss any potential opportunities.`
