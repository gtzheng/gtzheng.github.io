I am a PhD candidate in [Computer Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science)  at [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/).
My advisor is Prof. [Aidong Zhang](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/aidong-zhang).

My research centers on two primary objectives:

  - **Enhancing learning efficiency with limited data**: Developing methods to improve model performance in low-data environments.
  - **Building robust models resistant to spurious patterns**: Designing models that are robust to superficial or misleading correlations.

Application areas include:
  - Designing machine learning models to learn high-quality genomic representations.
  - Leveraging Generative AI for domain-specific information retrieval and knowledge discovery.
