I am a PhD candidate in [Computer Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science)  at [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/) (UVA),
advised by Prof. [Aidong Zhang](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/aidong-zhang).
Before joining UVA, I earned my Master's degree from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) and my Bachelor's degree from Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU).

My research in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning focuses on **developing robust AI systems capable of generalizing to new and diverse environments**.
My research involves:

- Bias detection and mitigation
- AI alignment
- Meta-learning
- Multimodal learning

In addition to solving fundamental machine learning problems, I am also passionate about **application-driven machine learning**, leveraging techniques such as self-supervised learning and generative modeling to accelerate knowledge discovery in genomics.
