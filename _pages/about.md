I am an AI Research Scientist at Accenture.
I obtained my PhD degree in [Computer Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science)  at [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/) advised by Prof. [Aidong Zhang](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/aidong-zhang).
Before joining UVA, I earned my Master's degree from the University of Science and Technology of China and my Bachelor's degree from Sun Yat-sen University.

My research is on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My main research theme is on **AI alignment and safety** from the perspective of **detecting and mitigating spurious correlations**, with topics covering:
- Shortcut learning in image/text classification
- Superficial learning in multimodal models
- Reward hacking in reinforcement learning
- Benchmarking superficial learning in AI models
- Robust reasoning and planning in agentic systems


In addition to solving fundamental machine learning problems, I am also passionate about **application-driven machine learning**, leveraging techniques such as self-supervised learning and generative modeling to accelerate knowledge discovery in genomics.
